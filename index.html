      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My journey started as a kid who always broke his remote control cars, using the motor to make fans and the LEDs to build small torches — just trying to understand each individual element that made up this product. Back then it felt like something I would never come to understand, but that curiosity never died out.
        <br><br>
        By the time I reached high school, I learned about the two aspects of technology: the hardware and the software. Since then, I’ve been passionate about understanding how they work together to build complex machines. I chose IT as a subject in Grade 10 even though I didn’t have a laptop — a requirement for the course. I struggled at first, but once I got my own laptop, I finally had the time to sit down and dive deep into coding. From that point on, I fell in love.
        <br><br>
        Now, as a Mechatronic Engineering student at NWU, I’m eager to explore how microcontrollers, circuits, and code can work in harmony. Whether it’s building, designing, or inventing, I’m driven to understand and create wherever I am.
